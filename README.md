# Homework1: Code Refractor

This week's homework Repository deals with Website Accessibility. Our primary task was to edit the code in order for the webpage to become more accessible to the reader. 
Some of the alterations included the following: 
* Alt Tags: Giving images a unique description to the reader.
* <section> tags: Improving the source code to a semantic HTML design.
* Order: Improving the source code's use of H1, H2, H3 tags to ensure that the page followed a logical structure.
* CSS:  Editing the style sheet to ensure that the updated CSS file was in sync with the updated HTML file.

Ultimately I want to improve upon my skills as I work with new repositories but I beleive that this project was a good start.
